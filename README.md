# MidiSaver
This is is a program that constantly listens for MIDI input and writes the MIDI input to a file.

The reason behind this is that sometimes I just play random stuff on the piano and I get inspired
to create a piece based on what I just played but I totally forgot to record myself while
playing random notes
